ðŸš€ Excited to share my internship experience at IT Planet as a Web Developer! ðŸŒŸ

During my time there, I worked on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and React.js, contributing to various projects, including:

âœ¨ Frontend development for a jewelry and travel website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
ðŸ’» Building the company's PHP-based website in React.jsâ€”a key project where I built a modular, clean-coded React application using routes, hooks, and animation libraries like WOW.js to enhance user experience.

This internship gave me hands-on experience in building scalable web applications and reinforced my skills in modern frontend technologies.

A big thank you to IT Planet for this opportunity! Looking forward to applying these learnings in future projects. ðŸ˜Š
